The RCW directories names for the LS2160ARDB boards conform to the following
naming convention:

abcde_fg_hijk_RR_l_m_n:

a = What is available on ethernet interface 1
b = What is available on ethernet interface 2
c = What is available on ethernet interface 3
d = What is available on ethernet interface 4
e = What is available on ethernet interface 5
f = What is available in Slot 1 (on Serdes 2)
g = What is available in Slot 2 (on Serdes 3)
h = SATA1
i = SATA2
j = SATA3
k = SATA4

For the Slots (a..k):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'H' is SATA
 'S' is SGMII
 'P' is PCIe
 'F' is XFI
 'I' is 4 XFI (40G ports used as 4*10G)
 'G' is 25G
 'L' is 50G
 'X' is 40G
 'C' is 100G

RGMII Interface (R):
  'R' is RGMII Interface 1G

Serdes1 protocol (l) in decimal:
l = 'serdes1 protocol value'

Serdes2 protocol (m):
m = 'serdes2 protocol value'

Serdes3 protocol (n):
n = 'serdes3 protocol value'

Ref clock setting on board
==========================
DDR Ref clock: 100 MHz
Sys PLL Ref clock: 100MHz

Files naming convention
=============================
rcw_x_l_m_n.rcw
rcw_x_l_m_n_bootmode.rcw
rcw_x_y_l_m_n.rcw
rcw_x_y_z_l_m_n.rcw

x = Core frequency
y = Platform frequency
z = DDR frequency
bootmode = nor(default)/sd
l = 'serdes1 protocol value'
m = 'serdes2 protocol value'
n = 'serdes3 protocol value'

For example,
  rcw_2000_19_5_2.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 2000MHz, with serdes1=19 serdes2=5 serdes3=2.
  rcw_2000_700_19_5_2.rcw means rcw for core frequency 2000MHz and Platform frequecny 700MHz, with serdes1=19 serdes2=5 serdes3=2.
  rcw_2000_700_2400_19_5_2.rcw means rcw for core frequency 2000MHz, Platform frequecny 700MHz and DDR Memory Data Rate as 2400 MT/s, with serdes1=19 serdes2=5 serdes3=2.
  rcw_2000_19_5_2_sd.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 2000MHz with SD boot, with serdes1=19 serdes2=5 serdes3=2.

Errata Workaround Implemented
=============================
A-009531:
  The PCI Express controller as the completer sends completion packets with IDO
  bit set in packet header even when the IDO Completion Enable bit is cleared in
  the controllerâ€™s Device Control 2 Register.
  Applicable for SNP PCIe controller

A-008851:
  Invalid transmitter/receiver preset values are used in Gen3 equalization
  phases during link training for RC mode
  This errata is valid only for PCI gen3.
  Workaround:
   write 0x00000001 to MISC_CONTROL_1_OFF
   write 0x4747 to Lane Equalization Control register for each lane
  Applicable for SNP PCIe controller
