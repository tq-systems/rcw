/*
 * Work-around for erratum A-010477
 *
 * Description:
 * The PCI Express controller core implementation follows a newer version
 * of the PIPE (PHY Interface for PCI Express) specification. With the
 * controller's default configuration, the Gen3 equalization negotiation
 * handshake signaling works slightly differently from what the device's
 * PCI Express PHY expects. As such, the controller may fail the Gen3 link
 * training with some Gen3-capable link partner and down-train to either
 * Gen1 or Gen2.
 *
 * Impact:
 * The PCI Express controller may not be able to establish the link at
 * Gen3 speed successfully with some Gen3-capable link partner. The link
 * will be down-trained to either Gen1 or Gen2 speed. However, the link
 * width negotiation is not impacted.
 *
 * Workaround:
 * Write the value of 0x0080_0401 to the GEN3 Control Register
 * (GEN3_RELATED_OFF) located at each PCI Express controllerâ€™s
 * configuration space offset 0x890 during the pre-boot initialization
 * (PBI) stage.
