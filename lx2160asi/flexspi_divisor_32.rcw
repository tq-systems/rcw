/*
 * FlexSPI controller supports modifcation of the FlexSPI Clock
 * divisor value, default value of this is 80.
 * For 750 MHz, FlexSPI clock runs with default value is
 *    (Platform Clock * 2) / (Divisor value)
 *      => 750 * 2 / 80 ==> 18.75MHz
 * Modify FlexSPICR1 register, to increase FlexSPI clock closer to 50MHz,
 * with divisor value as 32.
 *      => 750 * 2 / 32 ==> 46.875MHz
