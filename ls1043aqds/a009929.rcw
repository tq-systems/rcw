/*
 * A-009929: Multiple PCI Express outbound write transactions from a core
 * can cause a system hang
 *
 * Description:
 * Multiple PCI Express outbound write transactions initiated by the ARM
 * core targeting the 96GB outbound memory space (40_0000_0000h to
 * 57_FFFF_FFFFh) allocated for all three PCI Express controllers can
 * cause a system hang.
 *
 * The clock-gating logic of the deviceâ€™s interconnect fabric utilized
 * by the PCI Express outbound path does not work properly due to the
 * impact from the internal test logic. Because of this, consecutive
 * PCI Express outbound write transactions from an ARM core are lost or
 * not responded to properly. This further causes a system hang.
 *
 * Impact:
 * A system hang is observed for outstanding write transactions from ARM
 * core to the PCI Express outbound memory space (40_0000_0000h to
 * 57_FFFF_FFFFh).
 *
 * Workaround:
 * During the pre-boot initialization (PBI) stage, perform a register
 * write to address 2200_8040h with a value 0000_0001h.
