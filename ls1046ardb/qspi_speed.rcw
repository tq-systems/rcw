/* Increase the QSPI controller speed, rather than using default speed
 *
 * The QuadSPI configuration register contains the bits for QuadSPI configuration. This
 * register is reset at HRESET.
 * Address: 157_0000h base + 15Ch offset = 157_015Ch.
 * boot from hardwareROM/bootROM will happen at default speed, but once QSPI driver is init
 * increased speed can be observed.
 *
 * Top 4-bts are for CLK_SEL
 * These bits control the division of CGA1/CGA2 PLL clock to generate QuadSPI interface clocks.
 * 0000 Divide by 256
 * 0001 Divide by 64 (default) as per RM
 * 0010 Divide by 32
 * 0011 Divide by 24 (set to this now)
 * 0100 Divide by 20
 * 0101 Divide by 16
 * 0110 Divide by 12
 * 0111 Divide by 8
