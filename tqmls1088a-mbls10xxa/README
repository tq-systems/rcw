The RCW directories names for the TQMLS1088A SOM board conform to the following
naming convention:

ab_cdefghij_k_l:

a = 'R' indicates RGMII1@DTSEC3 is supported
b = 'R' indicates RGMII2@DTSEC4 is supported
    'N' indicates not available/not used

c = What is available on SerDes1 Lane0
d = What is available on SerDes1 Lane1
e = What is available on SerDes1 Lane2
f = What is available on SerDes1 Lane3
g = What is available on SerDes2 Lane0
h = What is available on SerDes2 Lane1
i = What is available on SerDes2 Lane2
j = What is available on SerDes2 Lane3

For the Slots (c..j):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'P' is PCIe
 'X' is XAUI
 'S' is SGMII
 'Q' if QSGMII
 'F' is XFI
 'H' is SATA
 'A' is AURORA

Serdes1 protocol (k):
k = 'hex value of serdes1 protocol value'

Serdes2 protocol (l):
l = 'hex value of serdes2 protocol value'

BIN   Core/Platform/DDR
Bin1: 1400MHz/600MHz/1800MT/s

Errata Workaround Implemented
=============================
A-009102:
	Default SERDES setting may cause excess errors in SATA controller
	Workaround: Write 0x502880 to LNmSSCR1 register for every lane
		before enabling SATA operation.Using PBI commands
		write 0x802880 to 0x01eb099c
		write 0x802880 to 0x01eb09dc

A-010554:
	SATA controller may fail to detect some hard drives
	Workaround: Before enabling SATA controller
		write 0x80104e20 to 0x1eb1300
		write 0x80104e20 to 0x1eb1310

A-000009:
	SATA Gen3 speed (6Gbps) exhibit high error rate
	Workaround: Before enabling SATA controller
		write 0x00502880 to 0x1eb099c
		write 0x00502880 to 0x1eb09dc

Files naming convention:
========================
rcw_x.rcw
rcw_x_bootmode.rcw
rcw_x_specialsetting.rcw
x = Core frequency
bootmode = bootmode:qspiboot and so on.
specialsetting = special setting:
			sben:Secure boot
For example,
	rcw_1400_qspiboot.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 1400MHz with QSPI boot.
